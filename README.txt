In our work we used the google colab .ipynb file.

the .py file is generated automatically from google colab.

The GAN folder contains the three trained models (Generator, Discriminatore and the combined model).

when executing the file, change the variable path named save_path
in the GANInpaintingModel class according to the GAN file location.
